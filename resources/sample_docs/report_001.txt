BACKGROUND: Patient was assessed to have risk for heart failure. She visited COPD clinic one month ago.
INDICATION: Right shoulder pain with limited range of motion.
TECHNIQUE: Magnetic resonance imaging of the right shoulder joint is submitted having been acquired in
the dedicated shoulder joint coil with standard protocol using sagittal, coronal and axial T1, T2, Stir and/or
GE sequences without IV contrast. Exam performed on 1.5 Tesla MRI system.
COMPARISON: None
FINDINGS: Biceps mechanism: The long head of the biceps tendon resides in the bicipital groove, and is
contained by the transverse humeral ligament. Intra-articular course of the long head of the biceps tendon
is uncomplicated. A SLAP lesion is not identified. The short head of the biceps tendon engages the
coracoid process of the scapula appropriately.
Labrum: The anterior and posterior cartilaginous labral tissue aligned appropriately. A slight irregularity of
the posterior labral tissue at the 9 o'clock position present with some undermining of fluid signal. There is
no peri-labral ganglion formation. There is no labral displacement.
Rotator cuff: Minor edema is present within the cephalad-most fibers of the subscapularis tendon, near
the lesser tuberosity engagement. The supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor muscles and tendons
are intact.
Osseous analysis: There is minimal fluid located within the AC joint and minor edema present within the
distal clavicle and the acromion process. There is mild AC joint hypertrophic osteoarthropathy. The
acromion process is congruent with the humeral head. The arch ligaments are intact. Bone cortical and
marrow signal intensity appropriate. Periarticular soft tissues: Negative.
No reports of bleeding. Multiple sclerosis positive. MS and MG is relocated.
