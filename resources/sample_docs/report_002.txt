INDICATIONS:$This patient has neck pain, radiating to the arms, and there is the possibility of disc
herniation causing radiculopathy.
TECHNIQUE:$$Magnetic resonance imaging of the cervical spine is submitted with standard
protocol sagittal and axial T1, T2, and/or gradient echo sequences, no IV contrast administered.
Exam performed on 1.0 Open MRI system.
COMPARISON: None
FINDINGS:$ The cervical cord appears normal in its size and signal characteristics.
The C2-3 and C3-4 discs are degenerated.
There is some mild bulging of the C3-4 disc. Neither level demonstrates central or neural
foraminal narrowing.
There has been prior fusion from C4 through C7 in good alignment and position. An anterior
screw and plate device is present.
At C4-5 and C5-6 there is no recurrent central or neural foraminal narrowing.
At C6-7 there is mild bilateral bony neural foraminal narrowing without central canal
compromise.
The C7-T1 level appears unremarkable.
IMPRESSION:
1. Mild bulging of the C3-4 disc.
2. Prior fusion from C4 through C7 in good alignment and position.
3. Anterior screw and plate device is present. Mild recurrent bilateral bony neural foraminal
narrowing at C6-7.
