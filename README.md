# SemEHR: Surfacing Semantic Data from Clinical Notes in Electronic Health Records for Tailored Care, Trial Recruitment and Clinical Research

With SemEHR, the clinical variables hidden in clinical notes are surfaced via a set of search interfaces. A typical process to answer a clinical question (e.g. patients with hepatitis c), which previously might involve NLP, turns into one or a few google-style searches, for which SemEHR will pull out the cohort of relevant patients, populate patient-level summaries - numbers of contextualised concept mentions (e.g. 2nd patient has 16 total mentions of the disease, 15 of them were positive and 1 is historical), and link each mention to its original clinical note.
